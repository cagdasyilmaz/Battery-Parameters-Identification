# Battery_Parameters_Identification

Welcome to the Battery_Parameters_Identification wiki!

In this repository, parameters of the second order equivalent circuit model of a battery is identified by using Recursive Least Square (RLS) method. 

By using on-line recursive identfication, Extended Kalman Filter is employed for state prediction.

This repository does not claim certain type approach for battery system identification. It is only employed academic approaches for battery parameters estimation.
